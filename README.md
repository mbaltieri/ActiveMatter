# ActiveMatter

This repository contains an implementation of active matter simulations, in particular active Brownian particles (ABP), based on
- [Callegari, Agnese, and Giovanni Volpe. "Numerical Simulations of Active Brownian Particles." Flowing Matter (2019): 211.](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-23370-9_7),
- [Marchetti, M. Cristina, et al. "Minimal model of active colloids highlights the role of mechanical interactions in controlling the emergent behavior of active matter." Current Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science 21 (2016): 34-43.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1359029416300024).

Active Brownian particles possess a self-propulsion mechanism and are endowed with repulsive interactions from other particles of the same kind. ABPs are used to model basic forms of self-organisation in non-equilibrium systems, given their rich phase diagram with a limited amount of parameters to tune.

My objective here is to investigate how to best use these systems to understand attribution of agency by observersers with questions like: 'When does a conglomerate of simple particles look *as-if* it self-organised into an agent-like structure?'.
